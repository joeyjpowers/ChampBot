## Program Purpose
We made this bot so League of Legends fans can have a good time while interacting on their League of Legends Discord servers. It also provides useful information on League of Legends champions and summoner spells, meaning it may just come in handy during gameplay.

## How it was Developed
We used Python to write the code to make Champ Bot function. We also accessed Riot Games API in order to retrieve League of Legends information.
